HELLO, Welcome Registration System with PHP and MySQL

These are the steps that you need to follow to get the system.

1-We need to have Xampp in our computer to make a localhost. (https://www.apachefriends.org/tr/download.html)\\n
2-After downloading Xampp, we have to start Apache and MySQl over the control panel of Xampp.
3-After that, please go to connection.php under registration file and replace the MySQL login data with yours there.\n
4-Then we need to put the folder named registration to xampp\htdocs.\n
4-Then go to http://localhost/registration/login.php now you have entered the system.\n
