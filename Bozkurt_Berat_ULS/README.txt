HELLO, Welcome Registration System with PHP and MySQL

These are the steps that you need to follow to get the system.

1-We need to have Xampp in our computer to make a localhost. (https://www.apachefriends.org/tr/download.html)
2-After downloading Xampp, we have to start Apache and MySQl over the control panel of Xampp.
You can face some starting problems in this case, it is better to look at video records of online lesson (28.04.2021). Samet hoca mentioned about the solution.
3-After that, please go to connection.php under registration file and replace the MySQL login data with yours there.
4-Then we need to put the folder named registration to xampp\htdocs.
4-Then go to http://localhost/registration/login.php now you have entered the system.
5-You can follow the database over MySQL Workbench or http://localhost/phpmyadmin/.

GOOD LUCK...
